title: Available Characters

While this blog is fairly new, we've been working on this game for some time now, so there is a bit of catch up to do with the progress of the game
on this website. First and foremost, letâ€™s talk about our characters, this is an RPG after all. This game features characters that resemble warriors from different time periods and varying empires. 

## Class

Like any role-playing game, characters are divided into classes, Swordsman, Lancer, Archer, Mage, Assassin, and possibly a new 6th class which is still under consideration. Of course, we try to put the historic figures we choose, into the class best suited for them as we plan to give significant importance to 
the play style of certain classes. We hope that this can give players a chance to try refreshing characters, as well as enforce strategic play. 

## Empires

This is fairly straight forward. As each character is based on history, we will be putting them into the empires they fought for, regardless at what point in time they were alive. In fact, this game gives zero regard to time frames at all so keep that in mind. 

Here is a list of characters which may or may not be in the game. If you are interested in seeing some of these characters I highly recommend checking [@maz.uri](https://www.instagram.com/Maz.uri/) on Instagram for some of the full body drawings!
