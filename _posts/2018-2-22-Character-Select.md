title: Character Select Part 2
---

Finally! The character select has everything in place for a fully functional screen. I still want to add a few small details for the final version but for the most part here it is!

The four soldier options available at the bottom and stats indicating the overall strength of the Battalion has been added. You can now pull up the soldiers from the bottom to reveal all the soldiers that are available, allowing you to pick and choose who you'd like in your battalion instead of spamming through the list. 

## Code

Once again the entire code for this menu is a lot of brute force and just simple structuring. There were some instances where I needed to go around multiple classes just to get a something to fade out. The key thing I leanred is definitely the importance of good naming especially when code gets incredibly long, and your only tool for survival is CNTRL-F. 

The majority of the code is now available [here](https://github.com/VaconnProductions/LostEmpireDev). Can take a look if your interested but be warry as its a complete mess. Thats all for now!
