title: Character Attack Animations
---

Now that first year is finished, it is time to update the blog! It has been a while since I have drawn these animations, and I can now clearly see the many problems with the previous ones. I have patched up some walking animations along with creating Hypatia and Alex's attacks.

## Hypatia

I actually did this during the small sliver of time I had during reading week. I realized that being lazy does not help at all, therefore I tried my best to draw her hands and cape as dynamic as possible in every frame. Before, I would try to create attacks that wouldn't move the limbs too much so that I could finish the animations faster. However, this does not make for an interesting character! So from now on I hope to create innovative and dynamic movements for all the characters.

## Alexander the Great

Here is an example of the full three attacks that will be standardized throughout all characters. I did allow myself to have the first to attacks as copies of each other, since my idea for the last attack was pretty extreme. The last attack took 9 out of the 19 frames for this entire animation. I do believe simplifying the first two attacks was a good choice, and allows me to keep some more ideas in store for the rest of the characters. The most dynamic part of this animation is definitely the arms, which pretty much move in all directions!

## TL;DR

Don't be lazy, but don't exhaust all your efforts into a small portion of a big project!
